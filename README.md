       What is MySQL?

    MySQL is a publicly accessible Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query language (SQL) to interact with databases. MySQL stores data in the form of tables that can be modified using Structured Query Language. Its adaptability with different computing systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, and Ubuntu has made it an easy-going RDBMS software option.
